<p>
It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. <br />
&#x2014;Charles Dickens, A tale of two cities
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It had been over a century since the last conflict among the civilised nations of Ceria. The campaign against Bucephal&rsquo;s legions had almost destroyed all of civilisation, and forced all the civilised nations to work towards peace. What followed was a generation of great people, who did everything to ensure another such catastrophe doesn&rsquo;t befall Ceria. As the saying goes, hard times make hard people, hard people make soft times, and soft times makes soft people. As the generation of people forged in the bowels of war dies, a new generation which has only ever known peace enters the politics of the world.
</p>

<p>
Peace however, is a fragile thing, and even the smallest disturbance can lead to absolute devastation. The recent assassination of the king of &#x2026;, the plague in the north and the growing influence of the Witonish Trade Company would all be easily resolved not half a decade ago, but now it seems like these could spark another era of conflict. In the east, there are rumors of cold winds returning to Ceria, after well over two millenia of summer; and cold winds could only mean one thing: the second age of men is coming to an end, the age of ice is about to begin&#x2026;

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-1">
<p>
The age of prosperity was the period between ~4000 PME and 1750 PME, largely dominated by the Lonian Republic. Legend has it that the the Lord of Civilisation, Lonyrus came down to earth to found the city of Lonium as a safehaven for his loyal followers. Not much is known about the early history of Lonium, and as such the early period is considered mostly mythical. The oldest written records date back to 2541 PME, when under the reign of Consul Gaius Piusidia Simena (also known as Simena Magnus), the Lonian Republic expands to cover all lands south of the river &#x2026; After this we have a fairly robust paper trail covering the republics various conquests.
</p>

<li><a id="org0403441"></a>The Lonian Republic: Avian Wars<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-1-1-1">
<blockquote>
<p>
To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; <br />
and where they make a desert, they call it peace. <br />
&#x2014;Calgacus
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Perhaps the republic&rsquo;s greatest moment of glory is in 2435 PME, when they defeat the Aarakocrai in the First Avian War. The First Avian War was a hard fought Lonium victory. The much larger, much more powerful Aarakocra Empire had the upper hand initially, thanks to their ability to fly. However, they underestimated human ingeniousity. It is said that to counter the Aarakocra, the Lonians built large ships with wings that could fly. They flew these ships into the towers of the Aarakocran cities, decimating them and leaving the Aarakocra defenseless. Eventually the Aarakocra surrendered their territories east of the mountains to the Lonians, in a humiliating defeat. This was the end of the First Avian War, but the start of a rivalry that continues to this day, albeit in a much less intense manner.
</p>

<p>
The Lonians were industrious and immediately began exploiting their newly acquired land. The inhabitants of the land were made slaves, and the resources of the land were pillaged. What goes around comes back around, and the gods would not be blind. It&rsquo;s possible if the Lonians had treated the land better that they could have avoided their fate, however that is a topic for much later. For now the Lonians were enjoying their ill-gotten gains with all the hedonism that they are known for. They had assumed the Aarakocrai would leave them alone after their humiliating the defeat in the war. They were wrong.
</p>

<p>
In the First Avian War, a group of Aarakocran soldiers, led by the general Aemos Sabara had successfully countered the Lonian attacks, by learning how to fight against their flying ships. The Aarakocran surrender felt like a betrayal to Aemos and his men, an admission of defeat now that they had finally got the tools to win. Nevertheless, Aemos accepted the defeat, but vowed to take revenge. After the war, he gathered his men and they headed south, to the dried salt lakes to train for their revenge. After conquering the vast plains for the Aarakocran empire, they start training their men, and planning their revenge.
</p>

<p>
Aemos spends the next 7 years creating the perfect killing machine; creating the warforged. These robotic machinations did not need to sleep, eat, drink or rest. They were trained by Aemos himself in the art of war, and they could obliterate any army on land, in the air, or on sea. Unfortunately Aemos would not be able to see his plan to fruition, since he would die of Avian flu a few months before the invasion were to begin. In his place, the invasion would be led by his son Aegon Sabara, better known in the west as Aegon the Ravager.
</p>

<p>
Aegon took his army of warforged, 500,000 strong, through the mountains and into the Lonium heartland. No army of flesh and bone could have survived the trip through the mountains, but the warforged were not made of flesh and bone. Thus began the second the Avian War in 2422 PME, with Aegon and the warforged burning through the Lonian heartland. Any natives who were found were freed and any Lonians who didn&rsquo;t surrendered were killed with extreme prejudice. Before long Aegon was on the the gates of Lonium itself, and it seemed like all was lost for the Lonians.
</p>

<p>
In a last ditch attempt, the Lonians would send a young general by the name of Fliuso Gusiusen Minusa. We now know of him as Minusa Fortiusa. Minusa was able to outmanuever Aegon&rsquo;s army, encircling them to stop their advance. This wouldn&rsquo;t stop them forever, but it bought him time. Having captured a warforged, they were able to reverse engineer the design of the machines, and create a virus that would pacify them. The dangerous task of spreading this virus among the warforged was taken up by Minusa himself, and thus ended the second Avian war. Aegon and his men chose to die rather than be captured, and the honorable Minusa granted them their last wish, by executing them himself.
</p>

<p>
In the ensuing peace, all lands of the Aarakocran empire were annexed by the Lonian Republic, and entire Aarakocran cities west of the mountains were razed, leaving nothing behind but ashes. Aarakocran men were enslaved to do hard labour, and women were taken by the Lonians as objects of pleasure. Their lands were exploited for stone, and their forests were destroyed timber. Only the largest of Aarakocran cities were allowed to remain, as a cruel act of mercy; leaving behind monuments but destroying the civilisation that created them.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-1-1-2">
<blockquote>
<p>
I go no further: approach, veteran soldier, and, if you can at least do so much properly, sever this neck. <br />
&#x2014;Marcus Tullius Cicero
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Having completely destroyed the Aarakocran empire, the Lonian Republic was practically unstoppable. The few remaining kingdoms quickly bent the knee to the Lonians, lest their cities be turned into ash, and their people be enslaved. By 1954 LME the empire came to rule all of Ceria, but as with all things, it was not meant to last.
</p>

<p>
It all started when a young noble by the name of Aurian Junius Antonius became consul in 1780 LME, with the help of his fellow noblemen. Aurian believed in reform, and passed many wide sweeping reforms that helped the poor of the empire. This made him popular among the peasants, and allowed him to stay in power. But nothing comes for free, and these reformed did not sit well with the other nobles. Nevertheless, since Aurian was consul there was nothing the nobles could do, for now.
</p>

<p>
In 1777 PME, Aurian tried to pass legislation that would nationalise all lands west of the mountains, so that peasants could work for the state and farm on these lands. These lands belonged to the nobles, who used slave labour to farm on these lands, keeping the produce for themselves and selling minute portions, so as to keep the price high enough to keep the peasants poor. This bill would be last bill Aurian ever authored.
</p>

<p>
In order to maintain their monopoly on the land, the nobles chose to assassinate Aurian, in cold blood. Thus on the 19th Sol of Volan, 1777 LME, the nobles arrived in court of Aurian and asked him to not pass the legislation. When he refused, they pulled out their blades, cut Aurian&rsquo;s tongue and nailed it on the door of his palace, as a warning to show what happens to those who run their mouth. They then brutally amputated Aurian&rsquo;s limbs, making sure he felt all concievable pain before dying.
</p>

<p>
They then captured, raped and killed his wives, children and sister. Unfortunately for the nobles, Aurian&rsquo;s youngest son Aurus, a boy just 14 years of age was not in the palace at the time, having gone out for a hunt. When the news of Aurian&rsquo;s assassination came out, there was open rebellion in all parts of the empire. The Aarakocrai in the northwest and the Warforged in the west, broke their chains and killed their slavers. Even the human peasants led by Aurus, joined their enslaved counterparts, and thus began the Long Revolution.
</p>

<p>
After 21 years of brutal fighting, the nobles were finally on the verge of defeat. Aurus&rsquo;s army was about to win the war and all of Ceria, when the nobles decided to do something unthinkable. Ever since the days of Minusa, the Lonians had possessed a secret weapon, a weapon so powerful its existance was only known to the Consul, and they were placed under divine oath to keep the secret. Legend has it that this weapon was designed by Dalpha to punish mortals, but it was stolen by Minusa after the Second Avian War, as a deterrent. It seems the nobles would rather all of Ceria be destroyed than give up their power.
</p>

<p>
Once the weapon was fired, there was no real way to counter it. Some tried to find shelter underground, hoping that would keep them safe. Some decided to spend the last moments praying, hoping for salvation up above. Some spent the last moments they had with their loved ones, cherishing their last moments with the people they love. Despite his advisors pleas to take shelter underground, Aurus stayed on the surface, choosing to face his death head on, rather than squirming in tunnels like a rat.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-2">
<blockquote>
<p>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br />
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare <br />
The lone and level sands stretch far away. <br />
&#x2014;Percy Bysshe Shelly, Ozymandias
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The weapon worked exactly as it was supposed to. It pierced the heavens and returned back to the ground with the force of a thousand suns. The ensuing fireball consumed all that was west of the mountains, creating a cloud of smoke and tar covering all Ceria. It burned all those unfortunate enough to be caught in its influence. It blinded all those who looked at its magnificient divine light. To those who survived it brought plague and pox. For the next 500 years, when it rained it would rain blackwater, dissolving all stone and timber. There would be no sun for the next 1000 years, and yet the land would be hot. There would be no moon for the next 1000 years, and yet the tides would be stronger than ever. Dalpha&rsquo;s fury was released on all Ceria, and the long summer had begun.
</p>

<p>
With conditions nearly unlivable above ground, most life stayed underground or inside large mountains. These communities founded their own societies, some attempting to preserve &ldquo;old world values&rdquo;, others taking a radically different path so as to not be shakled by the follies of a bygone era. A community of humans living in the mountains was one of those who let go of old world values. This community would build vast mines and tunnel systems in the mountains, living deep enough so as to not be affected by the blackwater. They would farm underground, using complicated systems of mirrors and lenses to make the most of little outside light they would get.
</p>

<p>
Living underground did not come without its downsides, and slowly humans adapted to the different conditions. Space was at a premium in the mountain mines, and this alongside the fact that the food they grew didn&rsquo;t recieve enough sunlight, slowly made these humans shorter. The poorer men, unable to afford good food, became shorter and soon height had become measure of your societal standing. These humans would eventually become the dwarves we know today, and though there isn&rsquo;t a shortage of food in the dwarven lands in contemperory times, height still remains a social discriminator.

Elsewhere, a collection of humans who originally sided with the nobles found vast underground lake systems. These humans had plenty of food through hydroculture and fishing. These humans attempted to preserve old world values, which to them meant the old systems of nobility and slavery. These humans grew tall and lived much longer lives, due to the lopsided nutrition they recieved from an almost purely piscetarian diet. The nobles chose to breed only among their own, being mistrusting of their slaves. Over the course of the next 1750 years that they spent underground, this inbreeding would lead to many defects becoming commonplace, most notably pointed ears and long straight hair. As you may have already realised, these humans became what we now know as the elves.
